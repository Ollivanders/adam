# ADAM - Automated Documentation Add-on Maker

This project allows you to create contents of your README and other documentation files procedurally.
You may wish to do this for a few reasons:

- In really large files, the markdown can get excessively long and hard to manage
- There is shared content between multiple files e.g. introduction in README.md and INDEX.md
- Things such as the project structure and screenshots for the project should be updated on change. This allows use of hooks to keep documentation on github uptodate
